Photo Select and Crop
=====================

<img align="right" src="https://github.com/gymsymbol/PhotoSelectAndCrop/blob/main/Screenshots/screenGrid.png" width="60%">

This repository shows one way to integrate a UIImagePickerController into a SwiftUI app. Obtain

1) a copy of the original image,
2) a scaled and / or cropped version of it,
3) a CGFloat, and 
4) a CGPoint. 

- The CGFloat and CGPoint represent the scale and position of the original image used to make the processed version. 

**Features:**

- By saving the original image and scale and position markers and passing them to the ImageMoveAndScaleSheet view, if the user taps the "Change photo" button, the original photo is scaled and positioned to allow subsequent adjustments.
